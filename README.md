WARNING: 
---
This library only supports the older, documented Realtime SDK protocol (http://bdml.stanford.edu/twiki/pub/Haptics/MotionDisplayKAUST/RealTimeSDKmanual.pdf)
That means that it is _very likely to not do what you want_, which is to connect to a more modern DataStream server. 
Datastream is, sadly, a closed protocol that you will have to use the official Vicon SDK for.
